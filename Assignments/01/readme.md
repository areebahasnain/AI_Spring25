# Question 1


# Question 2
### 1. Playing a decent game of table tennis (ping-pong)
Feasibility: Feasible.

Explanation: AI-powered robots have demonstrated the ability to play table tennis at a high level. These systems use advanced computer vision, real-time motion planning, and reinforcement learning to track the ball, predict trajectories, and execute precise paddle movements. While they may not yet match the adaptability and finesse of top human players, they can play a decent game.

### 2. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level
Feasibility: Feasible.

Explanation: AI systems like Suphx have achieved superhuman performance in bridge, particularly in online platforms. These systems use advanced algorithms to analyze probabilities, strategies, and bidding patterns. However, replicating human-like intuition and partnership dynamics in face-to-face games remains a challenge.

### 3. Writing an intentionally funny story
Feasibility: Partially feasible.

Explanation: AI models like GPT-4 can generate humorous text, including jokes and funny snippets. However, crafting a consistently funny story requires deep understanding of context, timing, and cultural nuances, which AI still struggles with. While AI can produce humor, it often lacks the creativity and subtlety of human-generated humor.

### 4. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law
Feasibility: Partially feasible.

Explanation: AI systems can assist lawyers by analyzing legal documents, identifying precedents, and providing recommendations. However, offering fully competent legal advice requires nuanced understanding of context, ethics, and client-specific factors, which AI cannot yet fully replicate. Legal liability and regulatory concerns also limit the use of AI for direct legal advice.

### 5. Discover and prove a new mathematical theorem
Feasibility: Partially feasible.

Explanation: AI systems like DeepMindâ€™s AlphaTensor and Lean have demonstrated the ability to discover new algorithms and assist in proving theorems. However, discovering and proving entirely new, complex theorems independently remains challenging. AI excels in exploring large search spaces and suggesting potential avenues for proof, but human intuition and creativity are still critical.

### 6. Perform a surgical operation
Feasibility: Partially feasible.

Explanation: Robotic systems like the da Vinci Surgical System can perform surgeries with high precision under human supervision. However, fully autonomous surgical operations are not yet feasible due to the need for real-time decision-making, adaptability to unexpected complications, and ethical concerns. AI can assist in planning and guiding surgeries, but human oversight is still required.

### 7. Unload any dishwasher in any home
Feasibility: Not feasible.

Explanation: Unloading a dishwasher requires advanced robotics, including dexterity, object recognition, and adaptability to different kitchen layouts and dishware arrangements. While robotic arms have made progress in controlled environments, handling the variability and fragility of real-world dishware in diverse home settings remains a significant challenge.

### 8. Construct a building
Feasibility: Not feasible.

Explanation: AI and robotics can assist in specific aspects of construction, such as design (via generative AI), site surveying (via drones), and bricklaying (via robots like SAM by Construction Robotics). However, constructing an entire building autonomously is infeasible due to the complexity of coordinating tasks, handling unexpected issues, and ensuring safety and compliance with regulations.


# Question 3
## AI Healthcare Diagnosis System
### *Agent Description:*
The agent is an AI-driven healthcare system designed to assist doctors by analyzing medical images, patient records, and lab reports to diagnose diseases.
It uses machine learning models (e.g., deep learning, decision trees) trained on large medical datasets to provide diagnostic recommendations with confidence scores.
The agent can also incorporate rule-based reasoning for handling well-defined medical protocols and guidelines.

Example actions: Detect abnormalities in medical images (e.g., tumors in X-rays), suggest potential diagnoses based on symptoms and lab results, and recommend treatment options.

### *Environment Characteristics:*
**Accessible:** Partially accessible. The agent has access to patient records, medical images, and lab results, but it may not have complete information about all symptoms, patient history, or external factors (e.g., lifestyle, environmental influences).

**Deterministic:** Non-deterministic. The same symptoms or test results can indicate multiple diseases, and the agent must handle uncertainty and variability in medical data.

**Episodic:** Sequential. Patient history and prior diagnoses significantly influence future recommendations, making the environment sequential rather than purely episodic.

**Static:** Dynamic. New patient data, lab results, and updates in medical research constantly change the environment, requiring the agent to adapt over time.

**Continuous:** Continuous. Real-time patient monitoring (e.g., vital signs) and ongoing lab tests provide a continuous stream of data that the agent must process.

### *Best Agent Architecture:*
**Hybrid AI System:**

Combines rule-based reasoning for handling well-defined medical protocols (e.g., "if symptom X and lab result Y, consider diagnosis Z") with deep learning models for pattern recognition and complex decision-making.

Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analyzing medical images and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for processing sequential patient data.

Incorporates uncertainty modeling (e.g., Bayesian networks) to handle the non-deterministic nature of medical diagnoses.

# Question 4

### 1. An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.
False.

An agent can still be perfectly rational even with partial information, as rationality depends on maximizing expected utility given the available information. For example, a stock trader may not have complete information about all market variables (e.g., insider information) but can still make rational decisions based on publicly available data, trends, and risk analysis. Similarly, a doctor diagnosing a patient may not have access to every possible test result but can still make rational treatment decisions based on symptoms and available medical history.

### 2. There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.
True.

A pure reflex agent cannot behave rationally in environments where decision-making requires memory or reasoning about past states. For example, in a negotiation task, where the optimal strategy depends on understanding the opponent's past behavior and adapting accordingly, a reflex agent would fail to act rationally. 

### 3. There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.
True.

In a trivial task environment where all actions lead to the same outcome or where there is only one possible action, every agent will behave rationally because there is no better alternative. For example, in an environment where the agent's only task is to "do nothing," any agent will trivially be rational. This demonstrates that such environments exist, even if they are simple or degenerate cases.

### 4. The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.
False.

The input to the agent program is the current percept (sensor data), while the input to the agent function is the entire percept sequence (history of percepts). The agent program uses the current percept to update its internal state and select an action, whereas the agent function maps the entire history of percepts to actions. For example, a voice assistant (like Siri or Alexa) processes the current voice command (percept) but relies on past interactions and context to provide meaningful responses.

### 5. Every agent function is implementable by some program/machine combination.
False.

Not every agent function is implementable because some functions require infinite memory or computational resources that are not physically realizable. For example, an agent function that predicts the exact winning numbers of a lottery draw is impossible to implement because lottery draws are designed to be random and unpredictable. Even if the agent has access to all historical data, there is no deterministic pattern to exploit, making such a function uncomputable.

### 6. Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the set of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational.
True.

In a deterministic task environment where all actions lead to the same outcome or where the agent's actions have no effect on the environment, selecting an action uniformly at random can be considered rational. For example, in a coin-flipping game where the agent's goal is to predict the outcome of a fair coin toss, choosing randomly is perfectly rational because no strategy can improve the odds. Similarly, in a maze environment where all paths lead to the same exit, a random agent would perform just as well as a deterministic one.

### 7. It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments.
True.

An agent can be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments if its actions align with the optimal behavior in both environments. For example, a vacuum cleaner agent can be rational in both a cleaning task (where it maximizes cleanliness) and a battery conservation task (where it minimizes energy usage), as long as its actions are optimized for the respective goals.
